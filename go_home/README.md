# Go Home!

## A Ruby on Rails app made for Holberton School internship application

### Background

During the first months at Holberton, I was privileged to meet Victor Nguyen, and whose support I would come to cherish during the first 9-months. One of my weaknesses was not being strict about self-care -- namely, going home and going to sleep at appropriate hours. Victor would often, dilligently, and consistently prescribe to me that I should "Go Home!" despite my persistent objections.

This application was a form of nostalgia, to honor a moment from those days.

### Usage
This application is not yet ready to be deployed, but to test it locally, clone the repository on your machine, and if you have rails installed, run:  
```
>> rails server
```
The application should now be served at:
http://localhost:3000/

### Overview
The goal was to make the application be an enhanced alarm clock, that tracks your consistency in following the time you had predetermined to go home. It tracks how long it took for you to respond to the alarm at each use, in hopes that it will motivate you into being more eager to respond quickly.

### Technologies Used
Rails 5.2.1
Ruby 2.4.4
