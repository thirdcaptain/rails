# Go Home!

## A Ruby on Rails app made for Holberton School internship application

### Background

During the first months at Holberton, I was privileged to meet batchmate Victor Nguyen, whose support I would come to cherish during the first 9-months. I wasn't very good about maintaining good sleep habits, and so Victor would often, dilligently, and consistently prescribe to me that I should "Go Home!" to rest.

### Usage
This application is not yet ready to be deployed, but to test it locally, clone the repository on your machine, cd into the go_home/ directory and if you have rails installed, run:  
```
>> rails server
```
The application should now be served at:
http://localhost:3000/

### Overview
The goal was to make the application be an enhanced alarm clock, that tracks your consistency in following the time you had predetermined to go home. It tracks how long it took for you to respond to the alarm at each use, in hopes that it will motivate you into being more eager to respond quickly the next day.

### Technologies Used
Rails 5.2.1
Ruby 2.4.4
